This repository contains a Python function that demonstrates a common error when dealing with unexpected input types. The function `my_function` compares two numbers and returns the larger one. However, when `None` is passed as an argument, the function raises a `TypeError` because the `>` operator cannot compare `None` and an integer. The solution demonstrates how to handle such cases using exception handling and input validation.
